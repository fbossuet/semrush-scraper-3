# Research Findings: Scraper SEM Parallèle

**Date**: 2025-09-16  
**Feature**: Scraper SEM Parallèle  
**Research Phase**: Phase 0 - Technical Context Resolution

## Research Tasks Executed

### 1. Playwright Authentication and Session Management for MyToolsPlan

**Task**: Research Playwright authentication and session management for MyToolsPlan

**Decision**: Use shared browser session with cookie synchronization between domains

**Rationale**: 
- MyToolsPlan requires authentication on app.mytoolsplan.com
- APIs are accessed via sam.mytoolsplan.xyz (different domain)
- Cookie synchronization ensures authenticated API calls
- Shared session reduces authentication overhead for parallel workers

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Individual authentication per worker (rejected: too slow)
- API-only authentication (rejected: not available for all endpoints)
- Session persistence (rejected: adds complexity without benefit)

### 2. SQLite Schema Design for Website Metrics Storage

**Task**: Research SQLite schema design for website metrics storage

**Decision**: Dual database architecture with two-table design (shops and analytics tables)

**Rationale**: 
- **Production Database** (/home/ubuntu/trendtrack-scraper-final/data/trendtrack.db): Live data for scraping operations
- **Test Database** (/home/ubuntu/trendtrack-scraper-final/data/trendtrack_test.db): Isolated testing environment
- Shops table: Core website information and processing status
- Analytics table: Metrics data with foreign key to shops
- Normalized design prevents data duplication
- Indexes on scraping_status and shop_url for performance
- Database switching capability for testing vs production

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single table with JSON metrics (rejected: harder to query)
- Separate table per metric type (rejected: too complex)
- NoSQL approach (rejected: SQLite is sufficient for this scale)
- Single database with test data (rejected: risk of data contamination)

### 3. FastAPI Async Patterns for Scraping Endpoints

**Task**: Research FastAPI async patterns for scraping endpoints

**Decision**: Async endpoints with background task management

**Rationale**:
- Scraping operations are I/O bound (network requests, DOM parsing)
- Async allows concurrent handling of multiple requests
- Background tasks for long-running scraping sessions
- Proper error handling with HTTP status codes

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Synchronous endpoints (rejected: poor performance)
- WebSocket approach (rejected: overkill for this use case)
- Queue-based system (rejected: adds complexity)

### 4. Asyncio Worker Pool Patterns for Parallel Processing

**Task**: Research asyncio worker pool patterns for parallel processing

**Decision**: Asyncio-based worker pool with shared browser session

**Rationale**:
- Asyncio provides efficient concurrency for I/O operations
- Shared browser session reduces resource usage
- Worker pool pattern allows configurable parallelism
- Proper error isolation between workers

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Threading (rejected: GIL limitations in Python)
- Multiprocessing (rejected: browser session sharing issues)
- Celery/Redis (rejected: adds external dependencies)

### 5. Error Handling Patterns for Hybrid API/DOM Scraping

**Task**: Research error handling patterns for hybrid API/DOM scraping

**Decision**: Graceful degradation with comprehensive error logging

**Rationale**:
- APIs may fail due to rate limiting or authentication issues
- DOM scraping may fail due to page structure changes
- Graceful degradation allows partial data collection
- Comprehensive logging enables debugging and monitoring

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Fail-fast approach (rejected: too brittle)
- Retry-only approach (rejected: doesn't handle permanent failures)
- Circuit breaker pattern (rejected: overkill for this scale)

## Technical Decisions Summary

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Hybrid Approach**: APIs for structured data, DOM scraping for complex metrics
2. **Shared Session**: Single browser instance for all workers
3. **Async Processing**: Asyncio-based parallel workers
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Continue processing even with partial failures

### Technology Stack
1. **Python 3.x**: Mature ecosystem, good async support
2. **Playwright**: Modern browser automation, better than Selenium
3. **SQLite**: Lightweight, sufficient for this scale
4. **FastAPI**: Modern async web framework
5. **Asyncio**: Built-in async support, no external dependencies

### Database Management
1. **Dual Database Architecture**: Production (/home/ubuntu/trendtrack-scraper-final/data/trendtrack.db) and Test (/home/ubuntu/trendtrack-scraper-final/data/trendtrack_test.db)
2. **Environment Switching**: Automatic database selection based on environment
3. **Schema Synchronization**: Both databases must maintain identical schemas
4. **Data Isolation**: Test database completely isolated from production data
5. **Backup Strategy**: Separate backup procedures for each database

### Performance Considerations
1. **Parallel Workers**: 1-3 workers for optimal resource usage
2. **Session Sharing**: Reduces authentication overhead
3. **Adaptive Timeouts**: Balance between speed and reliability
4. **Intelligent Re-scraping**: Avoid unnecessary work

### Error Handling Strategy
1. **Comprehensive Logging**: All operations logged with context
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Partial success is acceptable
3. **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts with progressive delays
4. **Status Tracking**: Clear status for each website (completed/partial/failed/na)
